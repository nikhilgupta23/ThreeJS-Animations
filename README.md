# ThreeJS-Animations
Animations made using the PIE library developed by IIT Bombay. PIE library is a JavaScript library which is a derivative of another JavaScript library called THREE.JS developed by @mrdoob.

## How to run animations
Clone the repo or fork it if you want to contribute. 

 - Host a server locally and copy the *PIE* folder along with animation folder you wish to run, to the server. For example, if you are using Apache, copy these to the *htdocs* folder.
 - Open a browser of your choice (preferably, Google Chrome).
 - Open **index.html** file hosted on the server. The address should look something like: `http://localhost:85/ExperimentName/index.html`<br>
 (Change the port number, if required, according to your server configuration).
